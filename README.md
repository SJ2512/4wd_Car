# 4wd Mobile Robot - Iterative Development (Important!!)
This mobile robot was developed during an early phase, at a time when documentation was not yet a priority. As a result, only limited images and video are available for the project. 
The project evolved through three versions, each building upon and upgrading the previous versions. These versions are organized into separate folders within the repository.
While complete media and original source code are not available for all versions, the repository provides a detailed breakdown of the hardware components, and control logic used in each iteration.
